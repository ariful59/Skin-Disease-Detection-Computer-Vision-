# Skin-Disease-Detection-Computer-Vision
** Skin Disease Detection Using Fine-Tuned CNN and Full Autoencoder **
# Overview
This project applies computer vision techniques to detect skin diseases using a combination of fine-tuned pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Full Autoencoders. The goal is to classify skin lesions by extracting key features from images for early diagnosis.

# Features
Fine-Tuned Pretrained CNN: Uses a pretrained CNN (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet) to extract general features and then fine-tunes the final layers on a skin disease dataset for specific classification.

Full Autoencoder: Compresses input skin lesion images into a lower-dimensional latent representation for enhanced feature extraction and classification accuracy.

# Technologies Used
# Programming Languages: Python

# Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV

# Techniques: Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders

# Approach
Fine-Tuning Pretrained CNN: Leverage pretrained models to speed up the training process and improve model performance by adapting it to the specific dataset of skin lesions.

# Autoencoder: 
Uses unsupervised learning to reduce noise and focus on the most relevant features of skin lesion images, leading to more accurate classification.
